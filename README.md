## ML Data Checker and Modifier

This repository contains scripts and tools designed to facilitate the cross-checking of data in machine learning projects.
## Overview

In the realm of machine learning, ensuring the quality and integrity of the data used for training models is crucial for achieving reliable results. This repository provides a collection of simple yet effective code snippets and utilities aimed at assisting in the validation and verification of data sets.

## Features

- Data validation scripts to check for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
- Data visualization tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pattern identification.
- Utilities for data preprocessing, including normalization, scaling, and feature engineering.
- Cross-validation techniques and performance evaluation metrics for assessing model accuracy.
- Integration with popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## List of Code Files

- [Checking dataset Cointain ROI or not](https://github.com/love-0710/ML-data-checker-or-Modifier/blob/main/dataset_roi_check.ipynb) : Script for checking if the dataset contains regions of interest (ROIs) or not.

- [Convert Keras Model to TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/love-0710/ML-data-checker-or-Modifier/blob/main/convert_keras_model_to_tflite.py): Convert a pre-trained Keras model to TensorFlow Lite format, which is suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, IoT devices, and edge devices.

- [TensorFlow Lite Inference](https://github.com/love-0710/ML-data-checker-or-Modifier/blob/main/tflite_inference.py) : This code snippet demonstrates how to perform inference using a TensorFlow Lite model. 

- [Resize Input Size of TensorFlow Model](https://github.com/love-0710/ML-data-checker-or-Modifier/blob/main/changing_model_input_size.py) : This code snippet demonstrates how to resize the input size of a TensorFlow model. It loads a saved model, modifies the input layer to the desired input shape, and creates a new model with the updated input size. 

- [Checking the overall quality of saved model](https://github.com/love-0710/ML-data-checker-or-Modifier/blob/main/checking_overall_quality_of_saved_model.py) : Script for checking the quality of the model.
